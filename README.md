brewpi-avr
==========

This is the code that runs on the BrewPi slave (AVR/Arduino)

This project uses Git Flow. The development branch is the newest branch. The master branch is the latest stable branch. This branch works out of the box with the official BrewPi shields. You can download the HEX files from the pre-compiled binaries folder to upload directly from the BrewPi web interface. Please right-click the 'RAW' button and use 'Save as..'.

The develop branch has better filtering and backlight auto-off timer. The web interface has not been updated yet, but you can already use it. You just cannot, and should not change the filter settings from the web interface with this hex file. Just click 'load default constants' after programming your arduino.

The diy-shield branch is an outdated branch for the old DIY protoboard shield. It is not up to date to work with the Arduino Uno.
